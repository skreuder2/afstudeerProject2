1: Two Hollywood Heavyweights and some bald, tatted rando with muthafuckin’ magician skills of balancing light fixtures on my head after 3 ?? tequilas. 
Always a pleasure choppin’ up our business with our @sevenbucksprod President, @hhgarcia41 and my lead agent and WME partner, Brad Slater @bslater9. 
Surround yourself with hungry, brilliant people who share your vision and go to work. 
We build out. We build big.

2: Got a visit from my JUNGLE CRUISE ?? ohana on the set of HOBBS & SHAW here in London. 
These two good lookin’ aliens have a lot going on. 
My partner in crazy, Emily Blunt/ the woman who’s delivering one of the greatest Christmas gifts of all time with her iconic turn as the one and only, MARY POPPINS in theaters Dec 19th. 
And @jackwhitehall who not only has his own NETFLIX special, but delivering an early Christmas gift as well in Disney’s THE NUTCRACKER in theaters Nov 2nd — and so defiant he wears my IRON PARADISE weightlifting belt backwards and dares someone to tell him he’s wrong. 
And finally, the big, brown, bald tattooed deadbeat in the middle who doesn’t have shit going on in his life and his biggest claim to fame is telling the world its classy to drink tequila before noon. 
Always good to see their faces. 
Cuz asses ain’t kickin’ themselves.

3: Sunday morning sideways shit show. 
All my baby girls are battling colds..?? Lil’ Jazzy comes into our bed to wake me up, lays on my chest and coughs directly into my mouth ????
I come downstairs to this beautiful mess and my French bulldog, Hobbs looking at me like, “Real talk brotha, I didn’t do shit... now go on and put some breakfast in my bowl and we gonna be cool” 
Good way to start my Sunday before I head into work!! #BringItOn ?????????

4: My (after sushi) cheat meal Cookie Train ?? ?? rolls on.
As I do every cookie cheat meal, I break out the Netflix, find the right viewing pleasure and begin to destroy. 
This week my DJ Signature double chocolate and peanut butter chip cookies with real peanut butter layered in the middle collides with @joerogan’s new comedy special #StrangeTimes. Highly recommend and mahalo for the shout out brother ????
And just to contextualize this image for you — I have the biggest laptop MAC that’s available on the market. That gives you an idea of how fucking gigantic these cookies are ????
Enjoy your cheat meals my friends - you’ve earned them. 
You ain’t cheatin’ if you ain’t eatin’. #CheatMealCookieTrain

5: My cheat meal Sushi Train ?? ?? rolls on... Worked my ass off all week to enjoy this masterpiece from a spot here in London, called #SushiShop. 
Highly recommend. 
I will apply my chess game techniques here by 
Attacking brilliantly 
Playing defense stunningly 
And ending it all with calculated precision. 
This soosh has zero chance of survival, but this game has no losers today. 
Winners only. 
Especially my greedy, glutinous belly. 
Enjoy your cheat meals my friends - you’ve earned them.
