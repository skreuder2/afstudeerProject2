2: Really enjoyed my time on today’s #ForcesOfFashion panel with the amazing forces that are @ashleygraham @kendalljenner @palomija ??
I am so grateful for any opportunity to share ideas and experiences with a group- doing it with my peers felt like, to me, the epitome of the camaraderie we share. I am truly grateful for the increasingly open-minded, intelligent, creative, & diverse community of the fashion industry - we have come a long way but we have to continue to discuss, learn, and improve!! Days like today make me feel extra lucky to do what I do. Thanks @voguemagazine and Anna for having me, and for your fight to always do better for the fashion community & for the world we make images&clothes for!

3: Celebrating my incredible lil sissy @bellahadid tonight! 22 !!!! Can’t believe. Witnessing you shine and share your loving light with the world fills me with pride, and I become more grateful each year for what a true friend you are to me. I love you beyond words my butterfly angel. Happy day, happy year - you deserve the best always !!!!!! ??????????
