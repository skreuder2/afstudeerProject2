1: A Celestial View from Orbit! Astronaut Nick Hague is safe and sound and back in Houston after last week’s mission to the International Space Station (@ISS) was aborted during ascent. Meanwhile, the three orbiting crew members continue ongoing research, maintenance and cargo packing.

2: Seen here is the Moon in June 2018, captured by an astronaut on the International Space Station (@ISS) looking through Earth's atmosphere from the orbiting outpost.

3: Our Operation #IceBridge mission began flying in 2009, but this year's Antarctic field campaign is the first time it's coordinating with our newly-launched #ICESat2 satellite. While IceBridge surveys the height of ice sheets from the sky, ICESat-2 measures them with lasers from space. During an Oct. 10 flight, the IceBridge team captured this photo of the Shackleton Range in Antarctica at sunset, with snow blowing off the ridges.

4: Since making landfall, Hurricane Michael has caused severe property damage and deaths in the southeastern United States. 
An instrument on the Suomi NPP satellite acquired data for this composite image in the early morning hours of October 11, as the storm passed over Georgia and South Carolina. The false-color image shows infrared signals known as brightness temperature, which helps distinguish the shape and temperature of the clouds. The image was overlaid on data from the instruments “day-night band.” Credit: NASA/NOAA/Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership

5: Do you like watching the Sun rise over the water? How about from space? An astronaut aboard the International Space Station (@ISS) snapped this photo of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula as dawn illuminated Lake Superior’s shoreline. Lake Superior is Earth’s largest freshwater lake by surface area.
