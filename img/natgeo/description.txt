83 years after its opening, Tsukiji fish market was closed on Oct. 6, 2018. Long-planned but controversial, the world’s largest fish market will be moved to a new 5 billion US dollar modern, enclosed structure. Tsukiji market will be razed in the coming months and replaced with a transit hub for buses during the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.

2:Photo by @simonnorfolkstudio | I was fortunate to travel to Socotra not just once, but twice. Here another two images of the astonishing white sand beach at Detwah Lagoon near Qalansia (or Qalansiyah). Socotra (Arabic: ?????????? Suqu?ra), is an archipelago of four islands located in the Arabian Sea and territorially part of Yemen. The largest island, also known as Socotra, lies about 380km (240mi) south of the Arabian Peninsula and 240km (150mi) east of the Horn of Africa. It has been described as ""the most alien-looking place on Earth”. As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species; up to a third of its plant life isn't found anywhere else on Earth. In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 endemic species; only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more.

In a few days, the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources #CCAMLR will meet to decide which areas of Antarctica should be protected. In the face of rapid climate change, maybe they should protect it all? On assignment for @NatGeo with @PaulNicklen and @CraigWelch. #follow @CristinaMittermeier to see more images from this upcoming story.

4: Photo by @andreabruce | Winter in Kabul, Afghanistan, can be beautiful yet deathly cold, especially for the thousands of people displaced by war living in camps on the outskirts of the city, mostly from warmer areas of Afghanistan. Here, Ibrahim holds his youngest son outside a mud hut where he lives with his wife and 11 children. The same camp buried at least two children who died due to the freezing temperatures that week a few years ago. #afghanistan #winter @noorimages
